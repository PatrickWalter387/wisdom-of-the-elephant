## Be an enabler. Allow people to grow and achieve their potential by clearing a path for their  full growth.

People are more willing to help than it seems, especilly if they are able to own their contribuitions. This sense of attribuition is
common in all branches of OSSS development. Build your comminities by empowerning your members and leave it wide open for
contributions.

This is the "champion" strategy, where one person lead the effort, but has many other peopele to help him execute the work. This
puts a passionate and motivated person in change and feeds his desire to make sure everything gets done. Enable him. Offer resources
and sponsors. Then focus on what you can do and let your people make sure all the other efforts are receiving attention and
being delivered.
