## Spend less than an hour helping the project you love.

People often think it requires lots of time to contribute to projects, but they're wrong. Even fixing a typo
in the documentation is already helping the project forward.

If you have about an hour to spend, see if you can help your favourite project and contribute. If 10 people spend one hour, 
that's already 10 hours worth of contributions.
