## Sharpen your tools.

I spent many years thying to find the right set of tools to do the type of work I wanted to do. Once I found them, I worked
to try and master them: editor, operanting systems, terminal emulator, scripting languages, testing frameworks, social media tools.
I know there is a temptation to chase what is popular or brings in money, but if your master your tools and the ideas behind them you
will find that opportunities just create themselves.
