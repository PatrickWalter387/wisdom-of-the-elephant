#### Learn the rules like a pro so you can break them like an artist. - Pablo Picasso

Thoroughout your career you'll be exposed to best practices, leadin practices, established sandards, conventions,
design patterns, and many other rules of the trade. At times they may seem pintless or arbitray (and some are), but most
are the result of the blood, swrat, and tears of those ho came before you. They are the hard-fought experience
of other developers who want  to save you the same pain and sufferning. Learn them. Fllow the rules.. except when you
shouldn't. No rule applies in all situations (including this one). Learn the Why behind the rules, too. The Why is important. Part of maturing
as a developer is uderstanding why a leading practice is leading... and when it no longer is. There is an art to coloring outside
when it no longer is. There is an art to coloring outside the lines, but you need to know What, Where, and Why the lines are. Then, when faced with
a situation where the convention really isn't the right course of action you can make a reasoned decision to break with convention - rather than just saying
"I don't get it, it must be stupid!"

Our industry has 70 yeears of hard-won experience behind it. Learn it, leverage it, benefit from it... and in so doing you'll learn how and when to break the rules
like an artist, not an amateur
