## Get past doubt by arming yourself with your own accomplishments. Remember that there are no accidents in life.

I felt like a total faker for a long time. Throughtou my twelve-year career in programming I'd say to mysql, "I shouldn't be here. I'm not smart enough. I have the wrong education. I don't deserve this."

After meeting some heroes and heroines of the programming world, imagine my surprise to learn that many of them have dealt with the same feelings of doubt! This led me to realize that people often see their accomplishments as accidents. Though I suspect the idea that I'm faking it will never go completely awat, consciously taking credit for what I've accomplished gives me the strength I need to go out and succeed.
